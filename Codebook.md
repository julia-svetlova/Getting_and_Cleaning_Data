The data set represents average data based on collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.

###Experimental design and background
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. 
Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) 
wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. 

###Raw data
Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, were captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity
at a constant rate of 50Hz.The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets,
where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 
The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled 
in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). 
The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth 
low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. 
The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff 
frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and 
frequency domain. 

###Processed data
Training and test data were merged to one dataset. Then only mean and standard deviation measurments were taken.
And finaly average values for each measurment for each activity and subject were calculated.

So this is a data set with 180 cases (rows) and 68 variables (columns).
We have data on 30 volunteers and 6 activities (walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, laying).
Columns contain following information:
subject - contains the unique id of particular volunteer
activity - contains the activity name done by particular subject_id
66 of rest columns are named by done measurments and contain average values for each subject and activity measurment.
